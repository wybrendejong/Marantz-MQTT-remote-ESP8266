MQTT remote for marantz receivers with a 'remote in' rca jack. In this case written for the NodeMCU ESP8266 in combination with the Marantz SR-96.
Easiest way to connect is to soler two jumper wires to a female rca connector, connect the main to the GPIO 15 on the ESP, and the ground to the ground.
Dont forget to fill in the necessary MQTT and WiFi info.
